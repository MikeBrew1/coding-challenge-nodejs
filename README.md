# Lead Software Engineer Test
Due to the overwhelming amount of applicants, we have created the following JavaScript test to improve our screening process. 

In order to complete this exercise, you will need a computer with NodeJS installed. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't yet.

Once it is installed, please fork this repo and clone it locally. Once you have cloned the repo, run the following commands to get started:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Goals
Your goal is to display a searchable table with weather data, using ReactJS on a NodeJS backend.

There are 2 main issues (one front-end and one back-end) with the pre-made project skeleton. 

# Requirement
Weather data should be consumed from the MetaWeather API (https://www.metaweather.com/api/location/2487956)

# Notes
Implementation details are mostly up to you but a few choices and suggestions were made in order to help you in your goal. You should be able to solve this challenge with additional 10 lines of code (or less). 

Once you are done, please push your changes to your repo and share it with us.
